      "protocol": "Mouse was anesthetized and transcardially perfused with 1\u00d7 PBS followed by freshly made EM fixative (2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 N cacodylate buffer). Spinal cords was removed and post-fixed in EM fixative overnight. Vibratome slices were treated with 0.2% OsO4 in phosphate buffer for 30 min, mordanted en bloc with 0.25% uranyl acetate overnight at 40\u00b0C, dehydrated with ethanol and embedded in Durcupan resin.",
